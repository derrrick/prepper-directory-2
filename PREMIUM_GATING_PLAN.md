# Premium Content Gating Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for gating premium content across the Prepper Directory website. The goal is to provide value to free users while creating compelling reasons to upgrade to premium ($9/month or $79/year).

## Technical Infrastructure

### Current Setup âœ…
- **Supabase Database**: `profiles` table with `subscription_status` field ("premium" or "free")
- **Stripe Integration**: Webhooks handle subscription lifecycle (create, update, cancel)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with email/password
- **Account Page**: Shows subscription status and management

### New Components Created âœ…
1. **`useSubscription()` Hook** (`hooks/use-subscription.ts`)
   - Client-side hook to check user's premium status
   - Returns: `{ isPremium, isLoading, user, subscriptionEndsAt }`
   - Automatically updates on auth state changes

2. **`<PremiumGate>` Component** (`components/premium-gate.tsx`)
   - Wraps premium content with access control
   - Shows blur effect + lock icon for non-premium users
   - Triggers upgrade modal on click
   - Props: `blur`, `showLock`, `feature`, `fallback`

3. **`<PremiumModal>` Component** (`components/premium-modal.tsx`)
   - Upgrade prompt with feature highlights
   - Shows pricing ($9/month or $79/year)
   - Links to premium page for checkout
